# ðŸ“± **compose-navigation**
A multi-module Android project demonstrating how to build a custom navigation library using Jetpack Compose. The app module serves as a sample integration point that brings together all feature modules.

âœ¨ This project heavily leverages Cursor AI â€” over 90% of the code in the `navigation-lib` module was written using AI-assisted development.

### ðŸš€ Features
The custom navigation library supports multiple types of navigation:

âœ… Navigation via Route â€“ Traditional string-based route navigation

âœ… Navigation via Deeplink â€“ URL-like deep linking support

âœ… Navigation via CustomDestination â€“ Type-safe, structured navigation using destination objects

### ðŸ“¦ Modules
navigation-lib: Core custom navigation library built with Jetpack Compose

app: Sample module integrating and showcasing navigation across features

feature-*: Modular feature implementations to demonstrate decoupled navigation usage

### ðŸ§  Powered by Cursor AI
The `navigation-lib` module was developed with substantial help from Cursor AI. Approximately 90% of the code was generated using AI-powered coding assistance, showcasing how modern tooling can accelerate complex architecture development.
